# cta-community-website

<p>small html4/5 website based on the idea of being a cat image database of sorts.</p>
<p>my first html website, took 4 hours to complete the index.html, thanks w3schools!</p>
<p>also, the word "cta" doesn't mean anything special, it's just a misspelling of cat that has become popular in the Grapejuice Linux community.</p>

# running

<p>the website is confirmed to work on firefox 78-97 by just double clicking on index.html or visiting the github pages version.</p>
<p>the website is also designed for the ubuntu font family, though if not on your computer it'll just load up any sans serif font you got on your pc.</p>

# html design guidelines

<p>if you're gonna add something, use plenty of comments, i personally don't care about a few bytes per addition dedicated to making the website maintainable!</p>
</p>if you're going to add something, make it fit in! late 90's to early 2000's design is highly reccommended! (you CAN use JavaScript, though personally i'd rather it be HTML since i only know css and html.)</p>
