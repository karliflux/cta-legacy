# cta-community-website

<p>small html4/5 website based on the idea of being a cta image database of sorts.</p>
<p>my first html website, took 4 hours to complete the index.html</p>

# running

<p>the website is confirmed to work on firefox 78-97 by just double clicking on index.html or visiting the github pages version</p>
<p>the website uses the ubuntu font family at the moment! this means ubuntu fonts are required for a good experience.</p>
<p>(im trying to find a suitable universal font be patient)</p>
